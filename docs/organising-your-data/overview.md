# Overview

This chapter covers the main building blocks that CiviCRM uses to store
data and offers advice on how to transfer and organize your existing
data. Using CiviCRM successfully depends on storing data in the right
place and in the right way, which can only happen with some thoughtful
planning of mapping your data into CiviCRM. 

Before thinking about CiviCRM structure, it is important to think about
the systems you currently have in place to store and organise your data.
Your data could be stored in spreadsheets, another database or CRM
(i.e. Constant Contact, Convio or The Raiser's Edge), paper files or in
someone's memory. In thinking about your contacts and their interactions
with your organisation, talk to your co-workers, including those who
have been around the longest and those who have just joined. Talk to as
many people as possible to get a complete picture of their interactions
with all kinds of contacts. 
 
Many organisations make the mistake of not thinking about who their
contacts actually are. Spend some time identifying all the people
involved with your organisation. What different types of people do you
interact with, and how do they differ from each other? The better you
understand them and their interactions with your organisation, the
better you can model them in CiviCRM. Anecdotal or systematic feedback
from your contacts may be useful. 
 
Here are some important questions to ask yourself about your current
data: 

1.  Do you have an existing CRM?
2.  Do you have spreadsheets with information about your contacts,
    donations or other valuable data?
3.  Do you have any post-it notes or file cabinets with information
    about your community?
4.  Does anyone at your organization know a lot about community members?
5.  How does money come into your organization?
6.  What are the day to day tasks your staff and volunteers carry out?
7.  How do you currently communicate with your donors, members,
    volunteers and other community members? How would you like to
    communicate with them?
8.  How do you track activities and communications (emails, meetings,
    webinars, other events) that you have with your community?
9.  Do you have a list of donors' interests and preferences?
10. How do you handle new contacts?
11. What classifications or labels are you using for your existing
    contacts (ie. alumni, students, parents, major donor, volunteer)?
12. Are there any reports you would like to create? What information
    will they contain?

CiviCRM has been designed to be flexible and adaptable, based on
feedback from many different non-profits, but it may not map exactly to
the ways that your organisation currently works. Doing things the
CiviCRM way could mean adapting your workflow and adopting best
practices in non-profit technology. Be pragmatic and flexible and
consider whether your current working practices need to change. 
 
It's worth remembering that CiviCRM offers many opportunities to
interact with your contacts in ways that you have not previously had.
Taking advantage of these new possibilities can lead to positive changes
and improvements.

## Think about the move

It might be useful to think about your pre-existing data in the same way
as the contents of a house or apartment when you need to move. People
often use moving as a chance to say, "Do we really need this? This stuff
is too old; let's trash it and get some new stuff once we have moved
in."

To apply this metaphor to your data, look for data that have no purpose,
such as old organisational divisions that you've abandoned or office
locations in a facility you no longer occupy.

Some old data will have continuing value. For instance, one organisation
in a financial pinch decided to use an old list of founding donors who
had not given money for many years. It turned out that these lapsed
donors still had strong emotional ties to the organisation that they had
founded and they came to its financial rescue. In that case, saving old
data was crucial.

Moving to a new living space doesn't just provide an opportunity to
evaluate what's really important to keep and what can be left behind; it
also gives you a chance to clean up everything that you do decide to
take with you. Just as you wouldn't pack up dusty picture frames and
dirty dishes because that would make your nice new clean place as dirty
as your old place, you'll want to clean up your data before moving it
into CiviCRM so that you're starting off with as clean and useful a
database as possible. You can read more about this in chapter "Mapping
your data into CiviCRM".

Also, in planning for a move to CiviCRM, prepare to spend a good amount
of time looking at your old data; standardising how different elements
of contacts' records are stored (e.g. are states entered as NY or New
York?) and deleting obvious duplicates, accidental entries, outdated
information, and corrupted records.

The following chapters will help you understand what data CiviCRM can
store and how best to map your existing records into CiviCRM
structure.
